# Data-Driven Linear Algebra

Video links and example notebooks for WDSS's workshop 'Data-Driven Linear Algebra'.

## Introduction

Linear algebra is an incredibly powerful tool for solving a wide range of theoretical and practical problems. That said, despite the modern economy becoming further powered data each day, little time is given in undergraduate degree courses to the data-centric applications of linear algebra.

In this three-part workshop series, we will introduce a linear algebraic technique known as the singular value decomposition (SVD). This is likely a new concept to many undergraduate maths students, yet due to its importance in a data-driven economy, is starting to find its way into many introductory courses (e.g. the latest iteration of MIT's introductory course).

The sessions break down the topic into three parts:
1) The motivation and theory behind the SVD
2) Practical approaches for computing the SVD
3) Application of the SVD to imaging/signal-processing/regression problems using Python/MATLAB

The sessions will be accessible to anyone with a basic (A Level) knowledge of matrices and no programming experience will be required.
